Design created using Solidworks

Download .STL files for use with most 3D printing software 

Base_SLD.STL : contains files for the base, including attachment on bottom for screw (for buoyancy control) and loop for insertion of flag (for locating samples)

Lid_STL.STL: contains files for printing a lid to fit the base. The lid should be printed with flexible filament.

Additional files included for interested parties are solidworks files for the base, lid, a skeleton of the tin size we used, and assembly (assy).
